# Breast Cancer Diagnostic Tool
## Project Overview
To create a web application to host a ML model that can accurately predict breast cancer diagnosis based on breast mass sample data.

## Data Collection
The data is taken from the Diagnostic Wisconsin Breast Cancer database
Features are from digitzed images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast tissue mass, and attempt to describe the characteristics of cell nuclei present in the image. There are 30 features present in the raw data used to create a classification model.

## Data Cleaning

## Logistic Regression Model

We will take numerical inputs in the form of the 30 features which are traditionally used to determine cell characteristics. This will be the input for a logistic regression model. The logistic regression model will provide a categorical value either begnign or malignant. 
The above equation is the logisitc regression equation used to transform our regression data to values between 0 and 1.
